		<h1>Question 1: Using 3 different internet networks (university wireless, university wired-common lab machines, home, coffee shop, 4G data plan for cellphone, etc.):</h>
		<h2>a. Measure the speed of each network using http://www.speedtest.net/, and take a snapshot for each one, include them in the answer level and caption them.</h2>
		<h3>THE ANSWER SHOULD BE WRITTEN HERE</h3>

		<br />
		<h2>b. What is the minimum internet speed (connection speed) you may consider as a web designer and why?</h2>
		<p>As a web designer, I would design for a minimum connection speed of about 1mbps. This covers most internet speeds in the cities and rural parts of North America. It is also compatible with 3G, 4G, DSL, coaxial, and fibre connections. Some sites may require more bandwidth based on the content they offer, making 1mbps hard to design for. </p>
		<br />
		<h1>Question 2: Choose a website you like that has a responsive design:</h1>
		<h2>a. Take 3 snapshots of the website using 3 different types of devices.</h2>
		<img src='pictures/responsive_laptop.jpg' alt='responsive website on a laptop' />

		<br />
		<h2>c. Does it have accessibility features? Give an example from the website.</h2>
		<p>This website does have accessibility features. The alt attribute in the img tags of the site contain descriptive info for the picture they represent. For example, the "processing" image has alt='processing... please wait'.</p>
		<h2>d. Which kind of viewing pattern does it have?</h2>
		<p>This website uses an F-based viewing pattern.</p>
		<h2>e. Does it have active white space or passive white space? Both? None of them? Example with a screenshot is required</h2>
		<p>This website contains a lot of passive white space. As shown in figures 4, 5, and 6, the whitespace on this site is a result of the placement of the square shapes used for navigation.</p>
		<br />
		<h1>Question 3: True or False</h1>
		<h2>a. The first time you visit a site, the entire contents of the HTML file, every image referenced in the HTML code, and any CSS style sheets are downloaded to your hard drive.</h2>
		<p>True. The browser will cache contents of the website.</p>
		<h2>b. To be successful, your website design must be portable and accessible by users who have different browsers, operating systems, and computer platforms.</h2>
		<p>True</p>
		<h2>c. When pages share the same color scheme, logo, structure, and navigation, the web site offers a smooth transition from the main page to a secondary page.</h2>
		<p>True</p>
		<h2>d. You can assume that a document that is perfectly legible on paper will be easily legible online.</h2>
		<p>False</p>
		<h1>Question 4: Fill in the blanks</h1>
		<h2>a.</h2>
		<p>a. <i>Paper-based designs</i> tend to have the same proportions as the printed page, which enforces scanning the page using paper-based reading habits</p>
		<h2>b.</h2>
		<p>White space that is used deliberately is called <i>active white space</i>.</p>
		<h2>c.</h2>
		<p>Provide <i>navigation choices</i> to the areas of your site that you find or expect to be in the greatest demand.</p>
		<h2>d.</h2>
		<p>A computer monitor's <i>resolution</i> is the width and height of the computer screen in pixels.</p>
