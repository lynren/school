	<h1>Question 1: Select a website of your own choice and take a screenshot for the main page. Remove all CSS links from it and take a screenshot.</h1>
	<h3>Screenshot with CSS</h3>
	<img src="../images/sectionacss.png" alt="website with css" />
	<h3>Screenshot without CSS</h3>
	<img src="../images/sectionanocss.png" alt="website with no css" />
	<p>Removing the CSS from mikescomputershop.com causes the whole design of the site to collapse. With CSS, the site has an easy to follow information structure, a nice navigation bar, and a search bar. All the content fits well within my browser and the content is centered in the middle. This makes a great user experience. Now, with the CSS gone, the site is just a vertical list of images and links in small font. There is no structure to the content and the webpage also becomes 800% longer. The website no longer looks like a website but instead looks like something quickly made in MS Word. Nobody would use this site without CSS.</p>
