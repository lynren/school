Lecture 1: Inception in Unified Process

1. CONCEPTS OF OBJECT ORIENTATION
	-"OO is about viewing and modelling the world as a set of interactice and interrelated objects"

	Four Main Principles:
	|	Abstraction: a model to include most important aspects while ignoring less important details
	|	Encapsulation: mechanism for restricting access to some components of an object
	|	Inheritance: mechanism of basing an object/class upon another
	|	Polymorphism: ability of different objects to respond to the same request message in different ways

OBJECTS
	-Corresponds to something in real world, tangible or untangible
	-contains information and exhibits behaviour

CLASSES
	-an abstraction of a set of logically related instances
		-includes rules to define object as its instances
		-includes a def. or template describing how to build the object
	-an attribute is a main property of a class
	-an operation is the implementstion of a service

2. O-O SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
	Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA)
		-emphasis on finding the objects in the problem domain
	Object-Oriented Design (OOD)
		-emphasis on defining software objects, and how they will collab to fulfill requirements

THE UNIFIED PROCESS
	-requirements
	-analysis
	-design
	-implementation
	-testing

	UP: Use-Case Driven
		-a written description of interactions between a role and a system
		-links requirements to implementation
	UP: Architecture-Centric
		-it is a theme from the earliest stages of a project
	UP: Workflow in Iterations
		duration: small and fixed length
		tasks: correct previous requirements and tackle new ones
		outcomes: tested, integrated, executable partial system
		usage: discover what works and what is of value

	Inception is the initial short step of a project
		-Outcomes, methods, objectives
