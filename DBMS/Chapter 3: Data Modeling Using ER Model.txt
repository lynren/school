 	Chapter 3: Data Modeling Using the Entity-Relationship Model

3.1 Using High-Level Conceptual Data Models for DB Design
	-1st step is req collection and analysis (data requirements)
	-2nd step is conceptual design. Create a conceptual schema
	-3rd step is implementation of the DB using a commercial DBMS
	-most DBMSs use an implementation data model. this step is called logical design/data model mapping
	-4th step is physical design

3.3 ENTITY TYPES, ENTITY SETS, ATTRIBUTES, AND KEYS
Entities and Attributes
	-entity may have a physical existence or conceptual
	-entities have attributes - the properties that describe it
	-attr can have a null value in some cases

	Composite vs Simple (Atomic) Attributes
	-composite can be divided into smaller subparts, representing more basic attrs
	-attributes that are not divisible are called simple or atomic attrs

	Single Valued vs Multivalued Attributes
	-attr w/ a single value is single. ex age
	-attrs w/ multiple values are multivalued. ex color
	-multivalued attrs may have constraints

	Stored vs Derived Attributes
	-some attrs can be derived from other attrs or entities. ex age derived from bday

	Complex Attributes
	-can represent arbitrary nesting by grouping components of a composite attr b/w parens, seperating components w/ commas, and displaying multivalued attrs b/w braces

	ER Diagrams
	-attribute & composite attr names enclosed in ovals attached to entity by a line
	-multivalued attributes displayed in double ovals

Entity Types, Entity Sets, Keys, and Value Sets
	Entity Type
	-defines a collection of entities that have the same attributes
	-in ER diagrams, represented as a rectangular box enclosing the entity type name

	Entity Set
	-collection of all entities of a particular entity type

	Key Attributes
	-uniqueness constraint on attribute(s)
	-used to identify entity uniquely. ex SSN
	-somtimes serveral attrs together form a key
	-underlined in an oval in ER diagram

	Value Sets (Domains) of Attributes
	-each simple attr is associated w/ a value set, specifying the set of values that may be assigned to that attr.

3.4 RELATIONSHIP TYPES, RELATIONSHIP SETS, ROLES, AND STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS
	-a relationship type R among n entity types E1,...,En defines a relationship set
	-in ER diagram, relationship types are displayed as diamond-shaped boxes, connecting to entity types

	RELATIONSHIP DEGREE
	-number of participating entity types

	RELATIONSHIPS AS ATTRIBUTES
	-an attribute of entity1, where the value set of the attr is the set of all entity2
	-for binary relationships

	ROLE NAMES
	-signifies the role that a participating entity from the entity type plays in each relationship instance

	RECURSIVE/SELF-REFERENCING RELATIONSHIPS
	-when the same entity type participated more than once in a relationship in different roles

	CARDINALITY RATIOS FOR BINARY RELATIONSHIPS
	-specifies maximum number of relationship instances that an entity can participate in
	-eg WORKS_FOR binary rel type DEPT:EMPLYEE is of cardinality 1:N

	(MIN, MAX) NOTATION FOR RELATIONSHIP
	-replaces cardinality ratio
	-associates a pair of integers with each participation of an entity E in rel R

	PARTICIPATION CONSTRAINTS AND EXISTENCE DEPENDENCIES
	-specifies whether existence of an entity depends on it being related to another entity via relationship type
	-specifies min number of rel instances each entity can participate in (min cardinality constraint)
	-Total Participation: every entity in a entity set must be related to entity2 via a relationship. Also called existence dependency
	-Partial Participation: some of the set of entities are related to entity2 via a rel, but not all
	-cardinality ratio + participation constraints = structural constraints

	ATTRIBUTE OF RELATIONSHIP TYPES
	-relationship types can also have attributes, similar to entities
	-attributes of 1:1 or 1:N relationship types can be migrated to one of the participating entity types

3.5 WEAK ENTITY TYPES
	-entity types that do not have a key attribute
	-identified by being related to specific entities from another type in combo w/ one of their attr values. This is the identifying or owner entity type
	-called the identifying relationship
	-always has a total participation constraint wrt identifying relationship
	-partial key can uniquely identify weak entities that are related to the same owner entity
	-in ER diagram, weak entities and their identifying relatioships are distinguished by surrounding their boxes and diamonds with double lines
	-in ER diagram, partial key is underlined with dotted line

3.7 ER DIAGRAMS, NAMING CONVENTIONS, DESIGN ISSUES
	-strong entity types are shown in rectangular boxes
	-weak entity types distinguished by being placed in double rectangles and their identifying relationship placed in double diamonds
	-relationships are shown in diamond-shaped boxes attached to participating entity types

	-attrs shown in ovals
	-component attrs of composite attr are attached to the oval representing composite attr
	-multivalue attrs shown in double ovals
	-partial key underlined with a dotted line
	-key attrs have their name underlined
	-derived attrs shown in dotted ovals

	-cardinality ratio of each bin rltn type is specified by attaching 1, M, or N on each participating edge
	-role names placed on edge of recursive relationship


	PROPER NAMING OF SCHEMA CONSTRUCTS
	-use singular names for entity types
	-should be read from top to bottom, left to right
