Chapter 8: Network Security

8.1 What is Network Security?
Confedentiality: only sender, intended receiver should "understand" msg contents
Authentication: sender, receiver want to confirm identity of each other
Message Integrity: sender, receiver want to ensure msg not altered w/o detection
Access & Availability: services must be accessible and available to end users

8.2 Principles of Cryptography

AES: Advanced Encryption Standard
-processes data in 128-bit blocks
-128, 192, or 256 bit keys

Public Key Crypto
-sender, receiver do not share secret key
-public encryption key known to all
-private decryption key known only to receiver

RSA: Rivest, Shamir, Adelson algorithm
-msg: just a bit pattern, can be uniquely represented by an integer number
-encrypting a msg is equivalent to encrypting a number

RSA: Creating Public/Private Key Pair
1. choose two large prime numbers p, q (eg 1024 bits each)
2. compute n=pq, z=(p-1)(q-1)
3. choose {e | e<n} that has no common facts with z (relatively prime)
4. choose d such that ed-1 is exactly divisible by z (ed % z = 1)
5. public key is (n,e). private key is (n,d)

RSA: Encryption, Decryption
1. to encrypt msg m (<n), compute c=m^e % n
2. to decrypt received bit pattern, c, compute m=c^d % n

8.31 Authentication
-goal: avoid playback attack
-nonce: number (R) used only once in a lifetime
-ap4.0: to prove Alice "live", Bob sends Alice nonce, R. Alice must return R, encrypted with shared secret key
-ap5.0: use nonce, public key cryptography

8.32 Message Integrity
Digital Signatures
-cryptographic technique analogous to hand-written signatures
-sender digitally signs document, establishing he is document owner/creator
-virifiable, nonforgeable: recipient can prove that sender, and no one else must have signed document

Message Digests
-fixed length, easy to compute, digital "fingerprint"
-apply has function H to msg m, get fixed size message digest, H(m)

Certification Authorities
-CA: binds public key to particular entity, E
-E (person, router) registers its public key with CA

8.5 Securing TCP Connections - SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
-variations: TLS: transport layer security, RFC 2246
-provides: confidentiality, integrity, authentication
-handshake: alice, bob use their certs, private keys to authenticate each other and exchange shared secret
-key derivation: alice, bob use shared secret to derive set of keys
-data transfer: data to be transferred is broken up into series of records
-connection closure: special msgs to securely close connection

8.6 Network Layer Security: IPsec
VPN (Virtual Private Network)
-data encrypted before entering public internet
-logically separate from other traffic

IPsec services: data integrity, origin authentication, replay attack prevention, confidentiality
IPsec Transport Mode: IPsec datagram emitted, received by end system
IPsec Tunnel Mode: edge routers IPsec-aware, hosts IPsec-aware
Authentication Header protocol: provides src authenticaction & data integrity, not confidentiality
Encapuslation Security protocol: provides src authentication, data integrity, confidentiality

8.7 Securing Wireless LANs
-symmetric key crypto: confidentiality, end host auth, data integrity
-self sync: each packet separately encrypted
-efficient: implemented in hardware or software

WEP Encryption
-sender calculates integrity check value (ICV, 4byte hash/CRC over data)
-each side has 104-bit shared key
-sender creates 24-bit initialization vector (IV), appends to key: gives 128-bit key
-sender appends keyID (in 8-bit field)
-128bit key inputted into psuedo rng to get keystream
-data in frame + ICV encrypted w/ RC4
	-bytes of keystream XORd with bytes of data + ICV
	-IV, keyID appended to encrypted data to create payload
	-payload inserted into 802.11 frame

WEP Decrytion
-receiver extracts IV
-inputs IV, shared secret key, into psuedo rng, gets keystream
-XORs keystreamm w/ encrypted data to decrypt data + ICV
-verifies integrity of data w/ ICV

802.11i: Improved Security
-numerous (stronger) forms of encryption possible
-provides key distribution
-uses authentication server separate from access point

802.11i: Four Phases of Operation
1. Disovery of security capabilities
2. STA and AS mutually authenticate, together generate Master Key (MK)
3. STA derives Pairwise Master Key (PMK), AS derives same PMK, sends to AP
4. STA, AP use PMK to derive Temporary Key (TK) used for msg encryption, integrity

8.8 Operation Security: Firewalls & IDS
Firewalls
-isolates organization's internal net from larger internet, allowing some packets to pass, blocking others

Stateless Packet Filtering
-internal network connected to internet via router firewall
-router filters packet-by-packet, decision to forward/drop packet based on:
	-src IP addr, dst IP addr
	-TCP/UDP src and dst port numbers
	-ICMP msg types
	-TCP SYN and ACK bits

Statefule Packet Filtering
-track status of every TCP connection
-track connection setup (SYN), teardown (FIN): determine whether incoming, outgoing packets "make sense"
-timeout inactive connections at firewall: no longer admit packets

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
-deep packet inspection: look at packet contents
-examine correlation among multiple packets: port scanning, network mapping, DoS attack
