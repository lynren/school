Lecture 1

Four Sources of Packet Delay
	dproc:	nodal processing
		-check bit errors
		-determine output link
	dqueue:	queueing delay
		-time waiting at output link for transmission
		-depends on congestion level of router
	dtrans: transmission delay = L/R
		-L: packet length (bits)
		-R: link bandwidth (bps)
	dprop:	propogation delay = d/s
		-d: length
		-s: propogation speed
	dnodal = dproc + dqueue + dtrans + dprop

Throughput

Protocol "layers"
	Internet Protocol Stack
		application: suuporting network apps. ex FTP, SMTP, HTTP
		transport:	process-process data transfer. TCP, UDP
		network:	routing of datagrams from source to destination. IP, routing protocols
		link:	data transfer between neighboring network elements. Ethernet, 802.111, PPP
		physical:	bits "on the wire"

	ISO/OSI reference model
		presentation: allow apps to interpret data. ex encryption, compression, etc
		session: synchronization, checkpointing, recovery of data exchange
		Internet stack missing these layers!
