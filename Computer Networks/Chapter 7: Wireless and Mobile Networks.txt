Chapter 7: Wireless and Mobile Networks
-wireless host: laptop, smartphone, etc. may be stationary
-base station: connected to wired network, sends pkts b/w wired ntwrk and wireless host
-wireless link: use to connect mobile to base station

7.2 Wireless Links, Characteristics
-decreased signal strength: radio signal attenuates (path loss)
-interference from other sources
-multipath propogation
-SNR: signal-to-noise ratio. Larger SNR, easier to extract signal from noise

Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
-unique code assigned to each user
	-all usrs share same freq, each usr has own "chipping" seq to encode data
	-allows multiple usrs to coexist and transmit simultaneously w/ min interference
-encoded signal = (data) X (chipping sequence)
-decoding: inner-product of encoded signal and chipping sequence

7.3 IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs (Wi-Fi)
-all use CSMA/CA for multiple access
-all have base station and ad hoc network versions
802.11b
-2.4-5 GHz unlicensed spectrum
-up to 11Mbps

802.11a
-5-6GHz range
-up to 54Mbps

802.11g
-2.4-5GHz range
-up to 54 Mbps

802.11n
-2.4-5GHz range
-up to 200 Mbps

-wireless host communicates with base station (access point)
-basic service set (BBS) in infrastructure mode contains: wireless hosts, AP, ad hoc mode

IEEE 802.11 MAC Protocol: CSMA/CA
Sender:
-if sense channel idle for DIFS, then transmit entire frame
-if sense channel busy, start random backoff time, timer counts down while channel idle, transmit when timer expires. If no ACK, increase backoff interval, repeat step
Receiver:
-if frame received OK, return ACK after SIFS

Avoiding Collisions
-sender first transmits small request-to-send (RTS) packets to BS using CSMA
-BS broadcasts clear-to-send (CTS) in response to RTS
-CTS heard by all nodes

802.11 Frame: addressing
-address 1: MAC address of wireless host or AP to receive frame
-address 2: MAC address of wireless host or AP transmitting the frame
-address 3: MAC address of router interface which AP is attached
-address 4: used only in ad hoc mode

7.4 Cellular Internet Access
-two techniques for sharing mobile to BS radio spectrum
	-combined FDMA/TDMA: divide spectrum in freq channels, devide each channel into time slots
	-CDMA: code deivision multiple access

7.5 Principles: Addressing and Routing to Mobile Users
3 approaches:
-routers advertise permanent address of mobile-nodes-in-residence via routing table exchange (not scalable to millions of mobiles)
-communication from correspondent to mobile goes through home agent, fwrd to remote
-corresepondent gets foreign addr from mobile, sends directly to mobile

Registration:
-mobile contacts foreign agent on entering visited network
-foreign agent contacts home agent 

Indirect Routing:
-mobile uses two addresses: permanent address (used by correspondent), care-of-address (used by home agent to forward datagrams to mobile)

7.6 Mobile IP
3 components to standard:
-indirect routing of datagrams
-agent discovery
-registration with home agent

Indirect Routing:
-packet sent by home agent to foreign agent: packet w/in a packet

Agent Discovery
-foreign/home agents advertise service by broadcasting ICMP messages (type=9)

home network: network of cellular provider you subscribe to
home location register: DB in home network containing subscriber info
visited network: network in which mobile currently resides
visited location register: DB w/ entry for each user in network

GSM: Indirect Routing to Mobile
-call routed to home network
-home mobile switching center consults HLR, gets roaming # of mobile in visited network
-home MSC sets up 2nd leg of call to MSC in visited network
-MSC in visited network completed call through base sation to mobile

GSM: Handoff with Commong MSC
-goal: route call via new base station (w/o interruption)
-reasons: stronger signal from new BSS, load balance
-old BSS informs MSC of impending handoff, provides list of 1+ new BSSs
-MSC sets up path to new BSS
-new BSS allocates radio channel for use by mobile
-old BSS tells mobile: perform handoff to new BSS
-mobile, new BSS signal to activate new channel
-mobile signals via new BSS to MSC: handoff complete. MSC reroutes call
-MSC old BSS resources released
