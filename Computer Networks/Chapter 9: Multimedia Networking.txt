Chapter 9: Multimedia Networking

9.1 Multimedia Networking Applications
Audio:
	-analog audio signal sampled at constant rate. eg. CD music: 44100 samples/sec
	-each sampled quantized, ie rounded

Video:
	-sequence of images displayed at a constant rate. eg. 24 images/sec
	-digital image: array of pixels, pixel represented by bits
	-coding: use redundancy w/in and b/w images to decrease # bits used to encode image
		-spatial: within image, temporal: from one image to next
	-CBR (constant bit rate): video encoding rate fixed
	-VBR (variable bit rate): video encoding rate changes as amount of spatial, temporal coding changes

9.2 Streaming Stored Video
	-continuous playout constraint: once client playout begins, playback must match original timing. Network delays are variable (jitter), so will need client-side buffer to match playout requirements
	-client side buffering & playout delay: compensate for network-added delay, delay jitter

Streaming Multimedia: UDP
	-server sends @ rate appropriate for client (often send rate=encoding rate=constant rate)
		-transmission rate can be oblivious to congestion level
	-short playout delay (2-5 seconds) to remove network jitter
	-RTP: multimedia payload types

Streaming Multimedia: HTTP
	-multimedia file retrieved via HTTP GET
	-send at maximum possible rate under TCP
	-larger playout delay: smooth TCP delivery rate

9.3 Voice-over-IP (VoIP)
VoIP end-end-delay requirement: needed to maintain "conversational" aspect
Session initialization: how does callee advertise IP addr, port #, encoding algos?
Value-added services: call forwarding, screening, recording
Emergency services: 911
Speaker's audio: alternating talk spurts, silent periods
	-application sends segment into socket every 20ms during talkspurts
Network loss: IP datagram lost due to network congestion (router buffer overflow)
Delay loss: IP datagram arrives too late for playout at receiver
Loss tolerance: depending on voice encoding, loss concealment, packet loss b/w 1%, 10% can be tolerated

VoIP: Fixed Playout Delay
	-rcvr attempts to playout each chunk qms after chunk was generated
		-chunk has timestamp t: playout chunk at t+q
	-large q: less packet loss, small q: better interactive experience

Adaptive Playout Delay
	-goal: low playout delay, low loss rate
	-approach: adaptive playout delay adjustment:
		-estimate network delay, adjust playout delay at beginning of talk spurt
		-silent periods compressed, elongated
		-chunks still played out every 20ms during talk spurt

VoIP: Recovery from Packet Loss
	-Forward Error Correction (FEC): send enough bits to allow recovery w/o retransmission
	Simple FEC:
		-for every group of n chunks, create redundant chunk by XORing n original chunks
		-send n+1 chunks, increasing bandwidth by factor 1/n
		-can reconstruct original n chunks if at most one lost chunk from n+1 chunks, w/o playout delay
	Another FEC scheme: "piggyback lower quality stream"
		-send lower resolution audio stream as redundant information
		-non-consecutive loss: receiver can conceal loss
		-generalization: can also append (n-1)st and (n-2)nd low-bit rate chunk
	Interleaving to Conceal Loss:
		-chunks fivided into smaller units eg. four 5ms units/20ms chunk

VoIP: Skype
	-proprietary application-layer protocol
	-P2P components:
		-clients: skype peers connect directly to each other for VoIP call
		-super nodes (SN): Skype peers w/ special functions
		-overlay network: among SNs to locate Skype clients (SCs)
		-login server

9.4 Protocols for Real-Time Conversational Applications: RTP, SIP
Real-Time Protocol (RTP) (RFC 3550)
	-specifies packet structure for packets carrying audio, video data
	-provides: payload type id, packet sequence #, timestamping
	-runs in end systems, packets encapsulated in UDP segments
RTP Header
	-payload type (7bits): indicates type of encoding currently being used
	-sequence # (16bits): increment by one for each RTP packet sent
	-timestamp (32bits): sampling instant of first byte in this RTP data packet
	-SSRC (32bits): identifies src of RTP stream. Each stream in RTP session has distinct SSRC

Real-Time Control Protocol (RTCP)
	-each participant in RTP session periodically sends RTCP control packets to all other participants
	-each RTCP packet contrains sender and/or receiver reports
	-feedback used to control performance

SIP: Session Initiation Protocol
	-provides mechanism for call setup
	-determine current IP address of callee
	-call management: add new media streams during call, change encoding during call, invite others, transfer/hold calls
SIP Registrar
	-once function of SIP server: registrar
	-when BOB starts SIP client, client sends SIP REGISTER msg to BOB's registrar server
SIP Proxy
	-another function of SIP server: proxy
	-proxy responsible for routing msgs to callee

9.5 Network Support for Multimedia
Dimensioning Best Effor Networks
	-approach: deploy enough link capacity so that congestion doesn't occur

Policing Mechanisms
	-goal: limit traffic to not exceed declared parameters
		-(long term) avg rate: how many pkts can be sent per unit time
		-peak rate: eg. 6000 pkts/min (ppm) avg: 1500 ppm
		-(max) burst size: max number of pkts sent consecutively
	-token bucket: limit input to specified burst size and avg rate
		-bucket can hold b tokens
		-tokens generated at rate r token/sec unless bucket full
		-over interval of length t: # of pkts admitted <= (rt + b)

Differentiated Services
	-want "qualitative" service classes
	-scalability: simple function in network core, relatively complex functions at edge routers
	-don't define service classes, provide functional components to build service classes

Forwarding Per-Hop Behaviour (PHB)
	-PHB does not specify mechanisms to ensure required PHB performance behaviour
	-expedited forwarding: packet departure rate of a class >= specified rate
	-assured forwarding: 4 classes of traffic: each guaranteed min amount of bandwidth
