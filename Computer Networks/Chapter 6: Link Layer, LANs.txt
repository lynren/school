Chapter 6: Link Layer, LANs

6.3 Multiple Access Protocols
-two types: point-to-point, broadcast
-2+ transmission by nodes: interference
-collision if node recieved 2+ signals at the same time
-distributed algo determines how nodes share channel

Channel Partitioning:
-divide channel into smaller pieces (time slot, freq, code)
-allocate piece to node for exclusive use
Random Access
-channel not divided, allow collisions
-recover from collisions
-eg: ALOHA, S-ALOHA, CSMA, CSMA/CD
Taking Turns
-nodes take turns, nodes w/ more to send can take longer turns
-polling from central site, token passing
-bluetooth, FDDI, token ring

Channel Partitioning MAC protocols: TDMA (time division multiple access)
-access to channel in rounds
-each station gets fixed length slot in each round
Channel Partitioning MAC protocols: FDMA (frequency division multiple access)
-channel spectrum divided into frequency bands
-each station assigned fixed frequency band

6.4 LANs
MAC Addresses
-function: used locally to get frame from one interface to another physically connected interface (on same network)
-48 bit MAC address burned in NIC ROM, sometimes software settable

ARP: Adress Resolution Protocol
-how to determine interface's MAC address, knowing its IP address?
-ARP table: IP/MAC address mappings for some LAN nodes

Ethernet
-sender encapsulates IP datagram in Ethernet frame
	-premable: 7 bytes used to sync receiver, sender clock rates
	-addresses: 6 byte src, dst MAC addresses
	-type: indicates higher layer protocol (eg IP, Novell IPX, AppleTalk)
	-CRC: cyclic redundancy check at receiver. error -> frame dropped
-connectionless: no handshaking b/w sending and receiving NICs
-unreliable: receiving NIC doesn't send acks or nacks to sending NIC
-mac protocol: unslotted CSMA/CD w/ binary backoff

Ethernet Switch
-store, forward Ethernet crames
-examine incoming frame's MAC addr, selectively forward frame 
-transparent: hosts are unaware of presence of switches
-hosts have dedicated, direct connection to switch
-switches buffer packets

VLANs: Virtual Local Area Network
Port-based VLAN
-traffic isolation: frames to/from VLAN can only reach ports in VLAN
-dynamic membership: ports dynamically asssigned among VLANs
-forwarding b/w VLANs: done via routing 
-trunk port: carries frames b/w VLANs defined over multiple physical switches

Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
-highspeed IP forwarding using fixed length label
-forward packets to outgoing interface based only on label value
-path to dst can be based on src and dst address

Data Center Networking
-load balancer: received external client request, returns result to external client
-rich interconnection among switches, racks
