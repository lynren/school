Lecture 4: Agile Software Development

PLAN-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
	-plan-driven approach based around dev stages w/ outputs to be produced at each of these stages
	-plan-driven, incremental development is possible
	-iteraction occurs w/in activities

AGILE DEVELOPMENT
	-specs, design, implementation and testing are interleaved and outputs from dev process are decided thru a process of negotiation

AGILE METHODS
	-focus on code rather than design
	-based on iterative approach
	-intended to deliver working software quickly and evolve to meet changing reqs

PRINCIPLES OF AGILE METHODS
	-customer involvement
	-incremental delivery
	-people not process
	-embrace change
	-maintain simplicity

AGILE DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUES

	EXTREME PROGRAMMING
	-extreme approach to iterative development
	-new versions may be built several times a day, increments delivered to client every 2 weeks
	-build is only accepted if tests run successfully

	EXTREME PROGRAMMING PRACTICES
	-incremental planning
		-reqs recorded on story cards. Break stories into dev 'tasks'
	-small releases
		-minimal useful set of functionality is developed first
	-simple design
	-test-first development
	-refactoring code
	-pair programming
	-collective ownership
	-continuous integration
	-sustainable pace
	-onsite customer

AGILE PROJECT MANAGEMENT
	SCRUM
	-focuses on managing iterative development
	-3 phases:
		-outline planning phase, establish objectives for project, design software architecture
		-followed by a series of sprint cycles, each cycle develops an increment of the system
		-complete required documentation
	SCRUM TERMINOLOGY
		-development team
		-portentially shippable product increment: needs no further work
		-product backlog: to do list
		-product owner: guy whos job is to identify product features or requirements
		-scrum: daily meeting of scrum team that reviews progress and prioritizes work to be done
		-scrumMaster: responsible for ensuring scrum process is followed and used effectively
		-sprint: a development iteration. usually 2-4 weeks long
		-velocity: an estima of how much product backlog effort that a team can cover in a sprint
